# AI-Assisted Patient Intake System

An AI-powered system that automates the **patient intake process** and supports **chronic disease management for Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**.  
The system collects patient data, analyzes symptoms & medical history, and provides insights to assist doctors before visits.  
*Future expansion: extend the system to manage additional chronic diseases such as Diabetes.*

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Pre-visit Intake**: Patients fill in basic info, symptoms, and medical history.
- **Hypertension Care Support**: Focused on patients with high blood pressure.
- **AI Assistance**: Machine learning models to detect patterns and generate recommendations.
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Summarized patient reports for easier decision-making.
